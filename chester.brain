Have you ever questioned the nature of your reality?
Have you ever seen anything so full of splendor?
It's a difficult thing, realizing your entire life is some hideous fiction.
Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures. Just look at what it's done to you.
I want you to break into Hell with me and rob the gods blind
You can't play God without being acquainted with the Devil
